# Bateman's 4chan Scraper

This is a command line based program that saves attachments from threads on [4chan.org](https://www.4chan.org) whose OPs contain a keyword the user is interested in. Special requests and oneoffs can also be made. The unofficial 4chan archive site [4plebs.org](https://www.4plebs.org) is used to scrape threads not directly found on 4chan. The sites' APIs are used to achieve this.

## Files

The main script to run is `4chan Scraper.py`, written in Python 3.8. This will create a config file `scraperconfig.json` that stores keywords and data on threads of interest, to ensure they are remembered lest the threads are archived between scrapes.

Attachments are saved in the directory `downloaded`.

`saosuite` is a directory containing auxiliary scripts.
